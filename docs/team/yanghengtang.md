### Project: MediConnect

MediConnect - MediConnect is a desktop clinic management application used for managing appointments between doctors and patients. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **View Feature**: 
  * What it does: Allows user to view the full detail of an appointment, doctor, or patient.
  * Justification: To keep the main window uncluttered, we had to omit the majority of the information related to an appointment, doctor, or patient. Therefore, the view feature enables the user to view the full detail of the entities whenever they want to.
  * Highlights: Whenever the view feature is called, a window consisting of the appointment/doctor/patient will pop up.
  * Credits: This feature was enabled with the JavaFX and Jackson library given the amount of GUI involved.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=yanghengtang&breakdown=true)

* **Project management**:
  * Weekly team meetings: Prepared the agenda and co-chaired the meetings.
  * Planned the mini deadlines to ensure the team is on track to meet the given deadline.
  * De-conflict any potential clashes between features with the same dependencies.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Implemented the new MediConnect-Turquoise theme to replace the Dark theme from AB3.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Wrote the introduction, guide to using the guide, known issues and command summary section.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Wrote the UI and Logic component section, implementation of View Feature, and some instructions for manual testing.
